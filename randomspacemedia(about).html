            <h1>About Startrain</h1>
            <p>
                Startrain is a web application developed as the final project for the Tomorrow's Web class. It is a web app that shows a random picture from NASA's Image and Video Library. There are three categories the user can see: Nebula, Galaxy and Exoplanet.
                <br>
                Besides the image itself, the application will display other key information about the image, such as the name, date it was taken, and the description written for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This application utilizes the API for the Image and Video Library in order to retrieve the images to be displayed by the web app. Application made by Ronalie Ribleza of Year III Group 2 in Creative Computing
